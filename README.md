* Project description:
 
SSV – Sleep SurVeillance
SSV is a user interactive system that will help the user 
keep track of their sleep over the week as well as predict 
the quality of their sleep based of their habits. 
It will take data such as hours of sleep, dinner eaten,
and screen time (before bed )as input, and will produce as 
an output two things. 

One: using machine learning models, the system will predict the 
quality of the sleep of the user and if it was enough or not 
provided the given inputs based on previous entries and available 
sleep date set. 
It will also provide mini recommendations for the user to help improve the 
quality of their sleep rather than the quantity. 

Two: Sleep Report portraying their habits over the week 
and how it impacted their sleep using graphs and tables .
