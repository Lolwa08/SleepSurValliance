SSV – Sleep SurVeillance


* Project description:
 
SSV – Sleep SurVeillance
SSV is a user interactive system that will help the user 
keep track of their sleep over the week as well as predict 
the quality of their sleep based of their habits. 
It will take data such as hours of sleep, dinner eaten,
and screen time (before bed )as input, and will produce as 
an output two things. 

One: using machine learning models, the system will predict the 
quality of the sleep of the user and if it was enough or not 
provided the given inputs based on previous entries and available 
sleep date set. 
It will also provide mini recommendations for the user to help improve the 
quality of their sleep rather than the quantity. 

Two: Sleep Report portraying their habits over the week 
and how it impacted their sleep using graphs and tables .

* How to run the project :

0.set up : 
Download the file 'Project Codebase' . Do NOT remove anyfile in it 
or edit it in any way . A sucessful download of the file should result in
the file 'Project Codebase' contaning a total of 34 files.

1.Open the file ' UserInterface_Code' using Thonny and run the code.
The Project uses a variety of libraries that are not automatically 
installed in Thonny .
You need to install pandas and sklearn and matplotlib .
	#To download panadas & Sklearn :
	Go to Thonny --> Select Tools -> Manage Packages
	search and install : 
		scikit-learn v.1.0.1 & sklearn v0.0
		pandas v.1.3.4
	
	#for matplotlib:
		pip install matplotlib


* NOTE : The sleepReport.py  is not meant to run on its own ,
if you would like to see the report without running the GUI , yun the sleep report 
sample. The other Sleep report is NOT meant to be editied by anyone .

* Short Commands:
After clicking ready , the key 'Enter' can be used 
to skip through the slides . All the data inputs required will 
be set to defeault . This means that if 'Enter' was pressed to skip the slides
at every entery. The Machine learning model will always get 7 hours of sleep,
No for dinner and No for Excersie , as these are the default val. 
However, the shortcut CANNOT be used for the loading slide.

This is meant to make you wait :)
